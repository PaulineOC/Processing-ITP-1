# Processing-ITP1-2-Creative Switch



Many people I know/see on the street walk around with their cellphones and wallets in their back pockets. I used to be one of those people (still admittedly, am sometimes) until last summer where I lost two iPhones, and I grew increasingly aware of the security I needed to maintain to ensure these expensive phones would no longer be lost/stolen. But now, butt-pocket users, fear no more – my switch adds security   to your life style.

My switch involves two plates that will line the pocket and when touching, the switch is “on.” The current is interrupted when a wallet or cellphone is placed between these two. Because one of the two plates is spring loaded with paper-clip springs, when the phone/wallet is removed, the plate will spring back and reconnect the current, and the switch will turn on. When the switch is on, the LED will light up, but also a little motor will vibrate to notify you that your stuff’s gone. Hopefully one day, when people start using Samsung watches or Google glasses, a message will be sent to those devices.

This new part incorporates a a watch. Basically, the user now has the option to turn off the motor and lit LED that activate when the phone/wallet is removed. With the power of the switch, the user can turn it to the “Off” setting to turn off the LED and motor. Once the phone/wallet is back in the pocket, the switch can be flipped back to reset the security.
